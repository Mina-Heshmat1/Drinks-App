To get started with this project,
head over to the Hello Code School project on Code School, and begin! It'll walk you through all of the steps below. They're included here in the readme in case you work better locally, or want to try working on this project offline.
## Prerequisites
In order to complete this project, you'll need to know the basics of Flutter! Aside from that, you'll need a local computer where you can install Dart, and edit some files. We'll walk you through that part, so if you haven't used Dart before -- don't worry. We recommend that you should have already completed Chat Gpt Front-End Foundations course, or have basic familiarity with Dart lunguega. When we say basic familiarity here's what we mean:

. Know what an Dart lunguega looks like

. Know some of the most common tags -- `title`, `Ux`,`ul`,`li`.

If you know these, you should be all set to jump in and give this project a shot!
